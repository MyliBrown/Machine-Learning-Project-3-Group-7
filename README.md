# Machine-Learning-Project-3-Group-7
This repository contains the code and output files for our third machine learning project for the group of Myli Brown and Ethan Stout. It covers the creation of a CNN model to classify a small dataset of images. 

## How to use:
Our code can be accessed in the file "Project3_code_group_7" and when connected to our image dataset, it will run all the way through, block by block. \
\
We were unable to include the zip file of our image dataset and our best cnn model file due to file size restrictions. However, these files will be submitted on Blackboard\
They are:\
